# NeuralNetCPP
A vanilla neural net implementation from scratch in C++, implementing the forward and backward passes to train the network.
I decided to start this project as a way for me to gain a deeper intution of the backpropogration algorithm, and to gain a little more appreciation for all the magic that goes on under the hood of the popular ML libraries we take for granted sometimes.
